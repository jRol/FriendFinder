# Friend Finder

## Homework 13 - Node and Express Servers

Problem: Build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. Deploy your app to Heroku.

Solution: Use Express to handle routing.

Technical Approach: The `server.js` file will require several npm packages: `express`, `body-parser`, and `path `.  The app will use Express to handle routing.
